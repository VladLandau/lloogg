Welcome to LLOOGG, a service that lets you check who is visiting your site in <b>real time</b>: which pages are being visited, with which operating system and browser, the referrer of each visit etc.
<p>
Do you already use <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> or a similar service? Great. But LLOOGG is different. We will show you stats about your visitors <b>as they access your site</b>, i.e. in real time.
<p>
If you're a blogger, LLOOGG will allow you to check readers' reactions to your posts and observe their navigation patterns in real time.
<h4>How does this work?</h4>
<p>
It's easy. <a href="/register.html.php">Create a user account</a>, paste the javascript on your web pages and you're done! In just a few seconds you will start seeing your stats in real time.<br/><br/>
<b>LLOOGG is an open source project.</b> Source code can be found <a href="http://github.com/antirez/lloogg">in this Github repository</a>.
